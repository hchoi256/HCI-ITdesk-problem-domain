My team investigated the problem domain of interaction between library employees and IT support in a library IT setting. We conducted our ethnography specifically at the LTG (Library Technology Group) helpdesk located in Memorial Library. IT technicians at the helpdesk interact with other library patrons and employees via a variety of methods. These include phone calls, emails, instant messages, and in person interactions. You can find more details in the [processbook](https://github.com/hchoi256/HCI-ITdesk-problem-domain/blob/main/Palmeter-Schultz-Choi-Processbook.pdf).
